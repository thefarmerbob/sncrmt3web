# Automatic Payment System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Successfully implemented an automatic payment system that creates payment invoices for colivers when their application status changes to "ONBOARDING". The system is fully automated and requires no manual intervention from admins.

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Payment Templates
- **Flexible Configuration**: Admins can create and edit payment templates with customizable titles, amounts, and due dates
- **Date Scheduling Options**:
  - Arrival Date: Payment due on coliver's arrival date
  - Departure Date: Payment due on coliver's departure date
  - Custom Offset: Payment due X days before/after arrival/departure
- **Amount Types**:
  - Fixed Amount: Set specific amount (e.g., ₩100,000 security deposit)
  - Total Stay Cost: Full booking amount
  - Percentage of Stay: Percentage of total cost
- **Dynamic Descriptions**: Templates with variables like `{coliver_name}`, `{chapter_name}`, `{arrival_date}`

### 2. Automatic Trigger System
- **Application Status Change**: When admin changes application status to "ONBOARDING"
- **Dual Creation Method**: 
  - SQL trigger creates coliver record
  - Django signal creates automatic payments
- **No Manual Intervention**: Completely automated process

### 3. Admin Interface Enhancements
- **Template Management**: Full CRUD operations for payment templates
- **Payment Tracking**: Clear indication of automatic vs manual payments
- **Bulk Operations**: Generate payments for existing colivers
- **Status Monitoring**: Track which payments are automatic

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Models
1. **AutomaticPaymentTemplate**: Stores payment template configurations
2. **AutomaticPayment**: Links payments to templates and colivers
3. **Enhanced Payment Model**: Added automatic payment tracking

### Signal Handlers
1. **Application Status Change**: Detects when status changes to "ONBOARDING"
2. **Coliver Creation**: Creates automatic payments for new colivers
3. **Payment Updates**: Updates payments when coliver details change

### SQL Trigger
- **Database Level**: Ensures coliver creation even with direct SQL updates
- **Reliable**: Works regardless of how application status is changed

## 📊 Current Default Templates

### 1. Security Deposit
- **Amount**: ₩100,000 (Fixed)
- **Due Date**: 7 days before arrival
- **Description**: "Security deposit for {coliver_name} stay at {chapter_name}"

### 2. Booking Payment
- **Amount**: Full stay cost (Total Stay Cost)
- **Due Date**: On arrival date
- **Description**: "Full booking payment for {coliver_name} stay at {chapter_name} ({arrival_date} to {departure_date})"

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Admins:
1. **Create Templates**: Set up payment templates once in admin interface
2. **Process Applications**: Simply change application status to "ONBOARDING"
3. **Automatic Creation**: System automatically creates:
   - Coliver record
   - All applicable payment invoices
   - Todo items for payment review

### For Colivers:
1. **Automatic Invoices**: Receive payment invoices automatically when onboarded
2. **Clear Information**: Payments include detailed descriptions and due dates
3. **Flexible Scheduling**: Payments due at appropriate times (before arrival, on arrival, etc.)

## 🎛️ Admin Controls

### Template Management:
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn templates on/off as needed
- **Edit Amounts**: Modify payment amounts and schedules
- **Custom Descriptions**: Personalize payment descriptions
- **Date Flexibility**: Choose when payments are due

### Payment Oversight:
- **Automatic Indicator**: See which payments are automatic vs manual
- **Bulk Generation**: Create payments for existing colivers
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor payment statuses and approvals

## 📈 Benefits

### For Admins:
- **Zero Manual Work**: No need to manually create payment invoices
- **Consistency**: All colivers get the same required payments
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify payment templates as needed
- **Scalability**: System handles any number of colivers automatically

### For Colivers:
- **Immediate Clarity**: Know exactly what payments are required
